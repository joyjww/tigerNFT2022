# tigerNFT2022

## Let's Start!
Welcome to the first tigerNFT2022 experiment project. You may mint your new Tiger NFT through your IDE. By downloading the whole project, you may start running the font-end through command line - **`npm run start`**. In the https://localhost:3000, you will see the main page (not the one to start with - .../TigerNFT2022). Then you can click and generate or mint your favoriate tiger. These tiger are generated through the alogrithm designed by [Gerald Bauer](https://github.com/geraldb). 

After you mint them, you may list them on the Opensea Rinkbey Market to sell them. Please note that the Rinkbey testnetwork sometimes is not stable and the whole process is for you to know what is NFT, what it is like to mint them and sell them using crypto wallets. 

Have Fun!
